# Equipment-Failure-Prediction

This was a Data Science Challenge given by ConocoPhilips.

## Challenge Description
As with all mechanical equipment, things break and when things break money is lost in the form of repairs and lost oil production. 
When costs go up cash goes down, but how can we predict when equipment will fail and use this information to drive down our costs?

## [Input Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/equipfails/data)
A [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/equipfails/data) will be provided that has documented failure events that occurred on surface equipment and down-hole equipment. 
For each failure event, data has been collected from over 107 sensors that collect a variety of physical 
information both on the surface and below the ground.

## Challenge Question
Predict surface and down-hole failures using the data set provided.
